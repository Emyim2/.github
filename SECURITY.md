# Reporting Security Issues

In case you discover a security issue in one of nanoFramework libraries, firmware or tools, please report it by sending an
email to [contact@nanoframework.net](mailto:contact@nanoframework.net), instead of opening an issue for it.

This way we can assess the risk and work on a fix before it gets public and maybe exploited.

We thank you for helping keeping nanoFramework safe for everyone using it.
